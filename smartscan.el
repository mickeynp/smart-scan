;; Smart Scan lets you jump between symbols in your buffer, based on
;; the initial symbol your point was on when you started the
;; search. Incremental calls will still respect the original search
;; query so you can move up or down in your buffer, quickly, to find
;; other matches without having to resort to `isearch' to find things
;; first. The main advantage over isearch is speed: Smart Scan will
;; guess the symbol point is on and immediately find other symbols
;; matching it, in an unintrusive way.

;; INSTALLATION

;; Install package
;; (package-install 'smartscan)
;;
;; Enable minor mode in a specific mode hook using
;; (smartscan-mode 1)
;; or globally using
;; (global-smartscan-mode 1)

;; HOW TO USE IT

;; Simply type `smartscan-symbol-go-forward' (or press M-n) to go
;; forward; or `smartscan-symbol-go-backward' (M-p) to go
;; back. Additionally, you can replace all symbols point is on by
;; invoking M-' (that's "M-quote")

;; CUSTOMIZATION
;; You can customize `smartscan-use-extended-syntax' to alter
;; (temporarily, when you search) the syntax table used by Smart Scan
;; to find matches in your buffer.

;; CHANGES

;; 0.3: Only consider `-' to be part of a word in LISP modes.
